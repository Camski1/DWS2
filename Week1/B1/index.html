				<h2 id="hist">History</h2>
				<p>	
					<strong>The first Wisconsin State Fair</strong> was held in 1851 in Janesville, with approximately 13,000 to 18,000 people in attendance.[4] Sponsored by the stateâ€™s Agricultural Society, it was held on a six-acre plot along the banks of the Rock River. It featured a 200-pound squash and a quarter-acre plowing competition with teams of horses and oxen. It was reportedly the largest gathering in Wisconsin history.[5]

					When the second fair was held in Milwaukee in 1852, fairgoers took their carriages for rides around the Cold Spring Race Course. The fair added new attractions each year, and in 1869, there was a fire engine demonstration where boxes, barrels and a large wooden building were set aflame. For decades, the fair moved from city to city, including Janesville, Watertown, Fond du Lac, Madison and Milwaukee, until 1892, when it was first held at its permanent and present location at Wisconsin State Fair Park.[5]

					During the 2011 fair hundreds of adolescent African Americans formed a violent flash mob and began attacking White[6] and Hispanic Americans[7] who were leaving the fair grounds. Eighteen people, including seven police officers, were injured during the event.[8] There were also reports of looting within the fair.[9] At least 31 people were arrested.

				<h2 id="event">Events and entertainment</h2>
				<p>
					Yearly features at the fair include a wide variety of vendors, many local and national bands, the Kids From Wisconsin, and a large assortment of food and drink, including cream puffs, which are one of the fair's most popular attractions. In 2010, the Wisconsin State Fair introduced Comet 2, a forty-foot roller coaster. New in 2012, the Wisconsin State Fair took over the Midway, creating Spin City, a collection of independently contracted rides including the Sizzler, the Freak Out, and the Stratosphere, a 200-foot-tall swing ride.

					The Main Stage features headline performance every evening of the fair. Many local bands can also be seen on smaller stages and pavilions located throughout the grounds.
					Agricultural exhibits of horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, and other animals are featured every year at the fair.
					The Wisconsin State Fair is also home of the Wisconsin Wine Garden. Established in 1996 by the then ten member-wineries of the Wisconsin Winery Association, the Wine Garden features wines from dozens of Wisconsin wineries.
